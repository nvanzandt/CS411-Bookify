# CS411-Bookify

## About 
Bookify is a web application that generates a Spotify playlist inspired by a user's chosen book. This project was made for my 
CS411: Software Engineering class as a team of 4 people. The assignment required that we create an application which uses a database, 
2 APIs, third-party authentication, and a decoupled architecture.
